various online communities such as 4chan, 7chan, dramatica

-Chris Forcand
-Hal Turner
-Chanology
-Iranian Green Party

Cause they're Asses:
-Epilepsy

Related to CS:
Software anonymizes your online identity/physical location
Hacking/DDOS - not CS, but still requires advanced computer skills
Sites like 4chan - definitely not CS
Being a CS student/grad: do you visit sites like 4chan? do you agree with some of
      the activities associated with the Anonymous name?
      Could you see yourself participating?

Tell you about Anonymous - who they are, and how it makes me feel.

Origins: 4chan
--------------
A home to memes, trolling, nsfws, racism, and lulz.
Anonymous: unnamed comments.

Acting as Anonymous
-------------------
Protests - Peaceful (why Anonymous?)
DDoS
SQL Injection
General trolling/defacement
Their actions are usually illegal, though protesters associate with Anonymous
They feel very strongly about censorship

You Can be Anonymous
--------------------
-Put on a mask and protest
-Access their IRC channels
-Take part in a DDoS
-We're CS majors:
 With great power comes great responsibility.
 We can get involved with hacking software.
 We can become proficient with anonymizing utilities.
 We care about open internet, censorship.

Conclusion
----------
Hacktivism is an extension of Protest.
  "the use of computers and computer networks as a means of protest to promote 
   political ends."
These acts are an extension of human nature.
The same spectrum is seen across the internet - anywhere you go.
