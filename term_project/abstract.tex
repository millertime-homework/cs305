``We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect 
us.''\\

Internet vigilantes, hackers, harassers. This faceless organization seems to 
have many faces, Guy Fawkes being the most prominent semblance. Originating 
from the worst corner of the internet, and now \emph{occupying} streets across 
the country, this group is showing what kind of world we now live in.\\
\\
I don't endorse all of the acts that Anonymous have carried out. However, some
of the injustices that are allowed to take place in our country definitely
need to be stood up to. Because of the nature of Anonymous it would be nearly
impossible to bring a halt to the growing momentum. In the meantime we can
appreciate the things they are doing that are a benefit to society.
